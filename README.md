# Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Analysis

This is a repo for a course at the Department of Cosmic Research, MSU. The course covers the very basic concepts of ML, it will be obligatory for 4th year students, but in 2020 it is an elective course.

# General info
- The course consists of 11-12 lectures and seminars and 5-6 homeworks.
- All lectures and seminars will be held **online** via Zoom and probably recorded (Zoom screen capture).
- PDFs with lecture slides will be published.
- All homeworks are to be submitted **online**.
- There will be no exams, final mark is based on homeworks only.

    "\n",
    "This notebook consists of numerous tasks but please make it look like a whole story: a report with your own code, thoughts and conclusions. In some of these tasks you will have to implement some custom functions, in some of them you will be asked to present some plots and describe them. Please try to make your code as short as possible and your answers as clear as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Each task has its value, **15 points** in total. If you use some open-source code please make sure to include the url. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to submit\n",
    "- Name your file according to this convention: `lab01_GroupNo_Surname_Name.ipynb`. If you don't have group number, put `nan` instead.\n",
    "- Attach it to an email with topic `lab01_GroupNo_Surname_Name.ipynb`\n",
